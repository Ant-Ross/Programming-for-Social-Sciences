ABM exercise

In this repository you will find the different script I used to built my ABM. However, the final version of the model 
can be found in the __Final Model__ folder. In order to run the model, you need to open both the _agent framework_ and the _model_ script.
Once you have opened them in Python, you will need to run the framework first and then the model itself.
